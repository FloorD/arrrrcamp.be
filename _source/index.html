    <h2>What attendees say</h2>
    <blockquote>
      I have a boatload of fond memories &mdash; beautiful city, delicious mojitos, great talks, lovely parties, and service above-and-beyond, well, everything!
      &mdash; <span class="author"><a href="http://twitter.com/kytrinyx">Katrina Owen</a></span>

    <blockquote>
      The organizers of ArrrrCamp put so much thought and heart into the event that it's always amazing. I've been twice now and have met intelligent people, laughed hard, and enjoyed some fantastic food and beer.
      <span class="author">&mdash; <a href="http://twitter.com/aeden">Anthony Eden</a></span>

    <blockquote>
      ArrrrCamp to me is a fun bunch of speakers on a variety of topics, a team of organizers with their hearts in all the right places, authentic Belgian-ness (it's a word!) and a lot of pirate references. Last years event even got me hooked on math riddles!
