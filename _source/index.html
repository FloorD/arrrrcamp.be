    <h2>A fantastic venue</h2>
    <p>
    This year's edition will take place at the <a href="http://www.handelsbeurs.be">Handelsbeurs</a>. This amazing concert hall with big lounge area is located smack in the middle of Ghent’s city center within walking distance of the old city parts and with plenty of hotels, restaurants and pubs nearby. Our infamous public transportation will get you anywhere you need to be. Coming by car? We have an underground car park at our doorstep. Literally.

        The organizers of ArrrrCamp put so much thought and heart into the event that it's always amazing. I've been twice now and have met intelligent people, laughed hard, and enjoyed some fantastic food and beer.

        ArrrrCamp to me is a fun bunch of speakers on a variety of topics, a team of organizers with their hearts in all the right places, authentic Belgian-ness (it's a word!) and a lot of pirate references. Last years event even got me hooked on math riddles!
