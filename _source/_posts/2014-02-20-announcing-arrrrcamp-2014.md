title: Announcing ArrrrCamp 2014
---

Arrrr mateys,

We are very happy to announce that ArrrrCamp is gearing up for edition 8, this time to be held on October 2nd and 3rd in our trusty city of Ghent. This edition will bring a number of changes, with the conference using a single track schedule and a fancy new venue as the biggest ones.

First things first though.

We're opening the [call for proposals](/cfp) as of today, and we're hoping you'll join our crew. This year we're hosting all our speakers at a hotel within 3 minutes walking distance of the venue, right in the middle of the city.

Are you not sure if you should submit a proposal? Do you have questions or doubts about the conference, the organizers, preparing a slide deck or talking in front of strangers? We're more than happy to help out. More than a couple people have given their very first talks at ArrrrCamp. Just [get in touch](mailto:captain@arrrrcamp.be)!

The process is anonymous, with your personal information hidden from us until after the selection process. We consider our attendees and our crew as a supportive, welcoming and generous bunch of people and implemented a [Code of Conduct](/coc) to back up that sentiment.

I hope you go [submit a proposal](/cfp) and we'll see you in October!
