Ahoy landlubbers!

In order to make your stay on the ArrrrCamp ship a little more comfortable we've partnered up with Accor Hotels to offer you a discount when booking a room with them.

You can use [this link](http://www.accorhotels.com/lien_externe.svlt?goto=spec_rate&t_fich=&client=&cont=&btp=0&all_cont=0&ragp=0&showEco=2&libelle_tarif=1&RA1=RA1CCW&multi_tarif=0&extendTk=0&RA2=&sub=ISP&nom_ville=0961,1455&jour_arrivee=01&mois_arrivee=10&annee_arrivee=2014&jour_depart=04&mois_depart=10&annee_depart=2014&nb_nuit=3&adultNumber=1&code_chaine=ALL&type_carte_fidelite=&num_carte_fidelite=&code_avantage=OPMIN) to book a room at a discounted rate.

Please note that all of these rooms include breakfast. Rooms will turn out to be a little bit cheaper *at the time of writing this* if you book through the regular booking process and choose not to have breakfast at the hotel. There will still be **breakfast at the conference** as well!

If you book at the **Ibis Gent Centrum Opera** you will be staying at the same hotel as our speakers, which is only a **3 minute walk** from the venue. The other option, Ibis Gent Centrum St Baafs, is about a 6 minute walk from the venue.

If you have any questions feel free to get in touch!
