Arrrr me harties,

Now that we know who will be speaking at ArrrrCamp (and so will you coming Friday) it is time to start putting together some events before, during and after ArrrrCamp.

Last year, Arne Brasseur organized Ruby Lambik, a tour of the Geuze and Lambik breweries around Brussels the day before ArrrrCamp. We thought these attendee-organized events were a great idea so we decided to create a centralized place to learn about these events or organize your own.

We think a conference is as much about this kind of events (impromptu or not) as it is about the talks. With that in mind we want to facilitate a varied program of things to do for those of you getting to Belgium early or leaving late.

Please register your interest or submit your own event(s) at http://events.arrrrcamp.be.[^1]

If you need a little more help to organize something feel free to get in touch with [the Captain](mailto:captain@arrrrcamp.be) and we'll work something out.

The ideas added by me (Hannes) are just ideas at this point, and because we're a small crew we will need to either pick the popular events or ask others to help out, as we can only be at one place at a time. I hope it gives you an idea of what is possible!

I hope to see you at one of the events during the days leading up to and following ArrrrCamp!

<3 The Captain
