    <h2>Rails Girls Hacka-what?</h2>
    <p>After every Rails Girls workshop coaches and organizers are overflowing with ideas to improve the Rails Girls guides. This ranges from fixing a typo to updating the guides to comply with the latest release of Rails all the way to adding entirely new guides to the curriculum. This is all great stuff but after the workshop real life hits and we fail to make time to actually do it. Because we have experienced and heard this over and over, we decided to get together at ArrrrCamp and get fixing. We invite all Rails Girls coaches, organizers, alumni, as well as anyone else interested, to come hack with us on the Open Source project that is Rails Girls.</p>
    <p><strong>Who is we?</strong> Anika Lindtner, Piotr Szotkowski, Oana Sipos and Floor Drees.</p>
    <p><strong>When is this taking place?</strong> Thursday evening starting sometime after the last talk.</p>
    <p><strong>And where?</strong> Right at the ArrrrCamp location. Don't worry, we'll put up signs.</p>
    <p><strong>What's with food and all?</strong> <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is taking care of dinner and drinks. Make sure to thank them! If you have any dietary restrictions please let us know in advance.</p>
    <p><strong>Sounds awesome, where do I sign up?</strong> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/arrrrcamp-x-rails-girls-guides-hackathon-tickets-13254782411" target="_blank">Over here please</a>.</p>
