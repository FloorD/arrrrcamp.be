  bio: Aaron was born and raised on the mean streets of Salt Lake City. His only hope for survival was to join the local gang of undercover street ballet performers known as the Tender Tights. As a Tender Tights member, Aaron learned to perfect the technique of self-defense pirouettes so that nobody, not even the Parkour Posse could catch him. Between vicious street dance-offs, Aaron taught himself to program. He learned to combine the art of street ballet with the craft of software engineering. Using these unique skills, he was able to leave his life on the streets and become a professional software engineer. He is currently Pirouetting through Processes, and Couruing through code for AT&T. Sometimes he thinks back fondly on his life in the Tender Tights, but then he remembers that it is better to have Tender Loved and Lost than to never have Tender Taught at all.

  title: Functional Programming for Rubyists
  bio: Arne is a developer, public speaker, programming coach, author and open-source contributor. With a passion for both human and programming languages, he has spent the last decade teaching and exploring the finer points of Ruby, LISP, Haskell, Mandarin Chinese, and others. When not hopping conferences or Pacific islands, he can be found at his home base in Berlin, brewing fine teas while pondering the future of open-source and the web.

    <p>Ruby isn't exactly know for being a functional programming language, but neither is it known for <em>not</em> being a functional programming language. With lambdas, blocks, and Matz himself citing LISP as a major influence, there is very little stopping us from writing code in a functional style.</p>
    <p>We'll cut straight through the smugness and jargon that typefies functional programming literature, and go straight to the essence. What does it mean to program "functionally", and what does it buy us. What patterns and techniques can we incorporate to write more flexible, maintainable code, and what are the caveats Rubyists specifically need to look out for.</p>

  bio: Fred is a software jack of all trades, having worked at every stage of the software development life-cycle. Having waded through tons of C++ and database programming, he discovered Ruby and its ecosystem and hasn't looked back since. After years in the corporate world he is now a freelance developer and consultant.

    <p>Have you tried BDD and given up? Thought it was too much trouble for too little reward? Didn't quite work for you? Fear not, you're not the only one. Many of us have been there, done it and got the 'not really my thing' t-shirt. But here's what I learned: it's not BDD, it's us! BDD works really well, but it has to be applied properly, following certain guidelines and avoiding specific errors.</p>
    <p>During this talk we'll demonstrate the best way to start our BDD journey by defining our system, discovering our Features and writing them correctly, identifying best practices, detecting common traps and pitfalls and learning how to avoid them.</p>

    <p>They're everywhere. They're on the leaf that falls from the tree straight on your head. They're on the building you pass everyday morning. They're on the socks you wear today and in the code you write. Patterns.</p>
    <p>Design patterns are defined as general, reused solutions to recurring design problems. The term, coming from architecture, appeared in software development 20 years ago and since then has been one of the most controversial topics among programmers. Are software design patterns really general and can be reused in various programs? Or are they just solutions with limited scope and don't deserve all the buzz they get? </p>
    <p>Let's have a short trip through the software design patterns we use, the one we don't need anymore and the ones we wish had never been used - all with a pinch of object orientation and a dram of dynamism.</p>

    <p>This talk will take you on a journey – from the days of the Easter Islands in the southeastern Pacific Ocean around 700CE, over the mid-15th century in England to Mars, rain forests and coral reefs of our days. On our way, we'll think about the relevance of Open Source Software technology-wise, see why the software we build is a hybrid and which impact this hybridism has on what we build and how. We'll think about Open Source Software's core values, and find out in which terms aiming for diversity (regarding gender, skills, ethnicities and ideas / backgrounds), user-centered approaches, democracy, decentralization and language will be core values when we're building the future of Open Source.</p>
    <p>This talk aims to encourage everyone of us to broaden our horizons when it comes to how far we can go collectively with all our Open Source projects when we're thinking about the future, - and it will show how widening our communities, aiming for diversity, sustainability and attracting new contributours to our projects will enable us to make this future a bright and great one together.</p>

    <p>Picking the right abstractions can be very hard. Understanding object design helps us evaluate tradeoffs, but where do you get the raw ideas to evaluate?</p>
    <p>A group of developers attempted to rewrite a registration system for the 3rd time, and it turned out amazingly well because of some creative thinking. We'll focus on several concrete practices that can help to spark the creative process and give you new ideas the next time you have to do some design.</p>

    <p>Fluffmuffin, peppercorn, gilligan — those are just a few of our users' plaintext passwords. I have 80,000 more, and it only took me 87 seconds to gather them from our customer database in a white-hat attack. In Act I of this talk, we'll cover the history of secure password storage, examine the hack, and mitigate the threat. Act II will address the difficulties of working on libraries with complicated external dependencies (like bcrypt-ruby, of which I'm now a maintainer). In Act III, we'll celebrate the power of global collaboration via OSS.</p>
