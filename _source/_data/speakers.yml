  bio: Aaron was born and raised on the mean streets of Salt Lake City. His only hope for survival was to join the local gang of undercover street ballet performers known as the Tender Tights. As a Tender Tights member, Aaron learned to perfect the technique of self-defense pirouettes so that nobody, not even the Parkour Posse could catch him. Between vicious street dance-offs, Aaron taught himself to program. He learned to combine the art of street ballet with the craft of software engineering. Using these unique skills, he was able to leave his life on the streets and become a professional software engineer. He is currently Pirouetting through Processes, and Couruing through code for AT&T. Sometimes he thinks back fondly on his life in the Tender Tights, but then he remembers that it is better to have Tender Loved and Lost than to never have Tender Taught at all.

    <p>They're everywhere. They're on the leaf that falls from the tree straight on your head. They're on the building you pass everyday morning. They're on the socks you wear today and in the code you write. Patterns.</p>
    <p>Design patterns are defined as general, reused solutions to recurring design problems. The term, coming from architecture, appeared in software development 20 years ago and since then has been one of the most controversial topics among programmers. Are software design patterns really general and can be reused in various programs? Or are they just solutions with limited scope and don't deserve all the buzz they get? </p>
    <p>Let's have a short trip through the software design patterns we use, the one we don't need anymore and the ones we wish had never been used - all with a pinch of object orientation and a dram of dynamism.</p>

    <p>This talk will take you on a journey – from the days of the Easter Islands in the southeastern Pacific Ocean around 700CE, over the mid-15th century in England to Mars, rain forests and coral reefs of our days. On our way, we'll think about the relevance of Open Source Software technology-wise, see why the software we build is a hybrid and which impact this hybridism has on what we build and how. We'll think about Open Source Software's core values, and find out in which terms aiming for diversity (regarding gender, skills, ethnicities and ideas / backgrounds), user-centered approaches, democracy, decentralization and language will be core values when we're building the future of Open Source.</p>
    <p>This talk aims to encourage everyone of us to broaden our horizons when it comes to how far we can go collectively with all our Open Source projects when we're thinking about the future, - and it will show how widening our communities, aiming for diversity, sustainability and attracting new contributours to our projects will enable us to make this future a bright and great one together.</p>

    <p>Picking the right abstractions can be very hard. Understanding object design helps us evaluate tradeoffs, but where do you get the raw ideas to evaluate?</p>
    <p>A group of developers attempted to rewrite a registration system for the 3rd time, and it turned out amazingly well because of some creative thinking. We'll focus on several concrete practices that can help to spark the creative process and give you new ideas the next time you have to do some design.</p>

  bio: "T.J. is a developer at Harvest, makers of the world's best time tracking software, where he writes a combination of Ruby and angry rants. He's also a maintainer of bcrypt-ruby, the best way to keep your users' passwords secure, and of rake-compiler-dev-box, the best way to successfully cross-compile your native gems without pulling your hair out."

    Fluffmuffin, peppercorn, gilligan — those are just a few of our users' plaintext passwords. I have 80,000 more, and it only took me 87 seconds to gather them from our customer database in a white-hat attack. In Act I of this talk, we'll cover the history of secure password storage, examine the hack, and mitigate the threat. Act II will address the difficulties of working on libraries with complicated external dependencies (like bcrypt-ruby, of which I'm now a maintainer). In Act III, we'll celebrate the power of global collaboration via OSS.
