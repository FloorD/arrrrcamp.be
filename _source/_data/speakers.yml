  bio: "Rachel is a developer at GitHub who loves ruby; she also does things she loves less, like javascript (coffeescript, really), email, and front end performance monitoring. She is on the Board of, and a volunteer for, RailsBridge, which holds free workshops around the world to teach Ruby and Rails to marginalized groups, including women, people of color and non-English speakers. In her free time she likes doing her nails and playing legos, which don't really go together well."
