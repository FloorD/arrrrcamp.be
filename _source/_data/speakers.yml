  title: Ruby keyword args and the options hash, from the parser to the virtual machine
  slug: etienne-barrie
  description: |-
    <p>Ruby has slowly but surely added support for keyword arguments.</p>
    <p>Starting from the implicit braces for a hash at the end of an argument list, it has grown up to required keyword arguments in 2.1.</p>
    <p>This talk will try to convince you that keyword arguments are a lie and don't even exist, and why you should use them anyway.</p>

  bio: "Rachel is a developer at GitHub who loves ruby; she also does things she loves less, like javascript (coffeescript, really), email, and front end performance monitoring. She is on the Board of, and a volunteer for, RailsBridge, which holds free workshops around the world to teach Ruby and Rails to marginalized groups, including women, people of color and non-English speakers. In her free time she likes doing her nails and playing legos, which don't really go together well."
