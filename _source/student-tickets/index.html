    <h2>ArrrrCamp Student Tickets</h2>
    <p><a href="http://2014.arrrrcamp.be">ArrrrCamp</a> is the only Belgian <em>Ruby and Rails conference</em> and we're already up to the 8th edition. The conference will take place on the <em>2nd and 3rd of October</em>. We use a single-track format in the fantastic theater room of the <em>Handelsbeurs</em> in the center of <em>Ghent</em> which can easily be reached by car or with public transport.</p>

    <p>We're hosting <em>two full days</em> of high-quality talks on all kinds of <em>topics developers love</em>, the biggest focus being Ruby. We're offering breakfast, lunch, plenty of coffee during the breaks and a number of fringe events during the evenings. Visitors will get to spend time with a friendly crowd of developers from all over the world in a fantastic venue.</p>

    <p>Although we're incredibly proud of the talks our speakers are presenting, the <em>hallway track</em> is our best kept secret. We encourage everyone to make friends or meet up with old ones, to discuss the sessions during the breaks, and to let the feeling of togetherness in this fantastic community sink in.</p>

    <p>Student tickets are <em>not limited</em> in any way, except for their price. You can <a href="https://ti.to/arrrrcamp/2014?release_id=qkfar7dnyha">reserve your seat here</a>.</p>

    <p>See you in October!</p>

    <p>The Captain</p>
